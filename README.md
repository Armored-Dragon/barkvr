## Core Focus:
- Accessibility: Making BarkVR welcoming to everyone, regardless of background or ability.
- Decentralized Design: Giving users the power to shape BarkVR's world through decentralization.
- User Empowerment: Providing users with complete control over their creations for a sense of ownership.
- Open Design: Welcoming collaboration and transparency to evolve BarkVR together.
- VR FOSS: Leading the charge in open-source VR for limitless innovation.
- Social VR: Creating a space where connections thrive beyond physical limits, fostering shared experiences and boundless imagination.

We're working to incorporate technologies like the Matrix messaging API for user managment and IPFS for our storage solution.
This means the whole platform is completely open and capable of being run/hosted without any reliance on the maintainers.

For those eager to follow BarkVR's progress, the "dev" branch is where the latest changes are. Main will eventually be reserved for tagged releases.
